# Python Programs

Platform = Linux 

I used Python 2 Libaries so use old version to use or default if you want to run in python3 so edit the code nd change that to ``print 'hello '`` to ``print('hello')`` then you can use in py3

```
chmod +x <filename>
./filename.py
```

Only portscanadv.py required python3 to run

```
python3 portscanadv.py <yourip>

```
Only For Educational Purpose don't use that code for any wrong purpose
